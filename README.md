attempt 2 to link to WI defect 37 in RTC.

configured Rational Team Concert via GitHub (settings > webhooks and services > configure services)

recieved a warning last time. toggled on no verify ssl and active option in configuring service. it did notice "defect 37" in commit message.

same warning, but now "test hook" works on github project settings. attempting again.

uncheck basic auth, check no verify ssl, check active
